## ðŸ§  Description

This project is part of the **Bachelorâ€™s Final Project in Computer Engineering**, and its goal is to **develop an educational virtual reality (VR) application** that simulates the process of **assembling and welding a 10s4p lithium battery pack**.

The application allows students to **safely practice** the assembly process, eliminating physical risks and optimizing material usage.  
The simulator recreates an **immersive virtual classroom** where users can interact with lithium cells, nickel strips, supports, and real tools modeled in 3D.

The project aims to **promote practical and safe learning**, aligned with the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, especially the goal of *quality and inclusive education*.
