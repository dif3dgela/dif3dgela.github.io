# Accessibility and Autonomy in Learning 🧩  
### Study of the 3D Manufacturing Process Adapted for Students with Visual Impairments

**Author:** Lorena Bocos Olabarría  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Supervised by:** Iñigo López Gazpio & Elsa Fernández Gómez de Segura  

## 🧠 Description

This project is part of the **Bachelor’s Thesis in Computer Engineering** and aims to **enhance accessibility and autonomy in learning through the use of 3D modeling and printing technologies**.  

In collaboration with the **IBT-CRI Donostia support service**, a study was conducted on the design, manufacturing, and evaluation of **three-dimensional pieces adapted for students with visual impairments or blindness**, to facilitate tactile understanding and learning in the classroom.  

The work combines an **educational, engineering, and artistic approach**, integrating 3D printing optimization practices with the design of **inclusive and sustainable educational resources**, including anatomical models and figures inspired by **Basque mythology**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Promote **educational inclusion** through the use of 3D technologies.  
- Design and manufacture **tactile teaching materials** adapted for students with low vision.  
- **Optimize 3D printing parameters** to improve durability and reduce material consumption.  
- Develop an **open-source 3D repository** of reusable educational resources.  
- Encourage **autonomy, accessibility, and sustainability** in learning.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **Blender** – 3D modeling of pieces and figures.  
- **UltiMaker Cura** – Print configuration and optimization.  
- **FDM 3D Printers (PLA)** – Manufacturing of physical models.  
- **Python / Excel** – Statistical analysis of impact and resistance tests.  
- **GitHub / Google Drive** – Version control and shared repository management.  

## 🧱 Results and Contributions

- Creation of **over 30 educational 3D models** adapted to various levels (from preschool to high school).  
- Evaluation of **14 infill patterns** and different print densities to identify the most durable configurations.  
- Construction of an **open-access repository (CC BY)** compiling the designed pieces and experimental results.  
- Direct collaboration with the **IBT-CRI Donostia service**, which will receive the printed pieces for classroom use.  

## 🔬 Examples of Designed Pieces

- **Low poly** and **high poly** anatomical models (male, female, and mythological “lamia”).  
- **Tactile educational figures** for science and biology.  
- Educational prototypes adapted for **inclusive STEAM education**.

## 📊 Print Optimization

Experimental tests determined that the **best configuration** for balancing durability and sustainability was:  
- **“Grid” or “Cross” infill at 10% density**,  
- **Layer thickness of 0.1 mm**,  
- **Standard PLA filament**,  
- **Two-dimensional infill pattern**, offering excellent strength-to-weight ratio.

## 🧾 Conclusions

The project demonstrates the **transformative potential of 3D printing in inclusive education**, by providing adapted and sustainable tactile materials.  
It also contributes to the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 4 and 12)**, promoting quality education and responsible production.  

In the future, the repository is expected to expand with new pieces using eco-friendly materials and optimized configurations.
