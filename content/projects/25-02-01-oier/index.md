## üß† Description

This project corresponds to the **Final Degree Project in Computer Engineering**, and aims to **explore the integration capacity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in video game development with Unity**.

To achieve this, a **Tower Defense type video game** has been developed as a prototype, integrating different traditional AI algorithms (such as *A\** and improved versions) and evaluating the use of **generative AI** for creating 3D assets through tools like *StableFast3D* and *Blender*, in addition to testing in **virtual reality** environments.


## üéÆ Video Game Features

- **Tower Defense** strategy game developed in **Unity (C#)**.  
- Implementation of **pathfinding AI** using:
  - Random algorithm
  - A* algorithm
  - Improved version of A*
- **Dynamic difficulty** system, where enemies change their behavior in real time.
- Evaluation of **assets generated by generative AI** (StableFast3D + Blender + VR).
- Fully functional **economy, enemy waves, HUD and UI** system.

## üß© Technologies Used

- **Unity** ‚Äì Main development engine  
- **C#** ‚Äì Programming language  
- **Blender** ‚Äì 3D asset modeling and analysis  
- **StableFast3D** ‚Äì Generative AI for 3D model creation  
- **SteamVR / OpenXR / ALVR** ‚Äì Virtual reality integration  
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì Version control
